  "body": "# Partial Pressure Calculator\r\n\r\nThis command-line application calculates partial pressures of the most popular breathing mixes used for diving:\r\n* Air\r\n* Nitrox 32/68\r\n* Nitrox 36/64\r\n* Nitrox 40/60\r\n* Oxygen\r\n* Trimix 20/25\r\n\r\nThese breathing mixes are composed of the following gases : O2, N2 and He.\r\n\r\nThis calculation is based on Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures that states:\r\n* each gas in a mixture of gases exerts a pressure, known as its partial pressure, that is equal to the pressure the gas would exert if it were the only gas present\r\n* the total pressure of the mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of all the gases present.\r\n\r\nA mathematical expression of the Law of Partial Pressures is:\r\n\r\n> Ptotal = P1 + P2 + P3 + · · ·\r\n\r\n## Build and Run\r\n\r\nThis application uses Spring Shell. To build it, issue this command in the project's root directory :\r\n\r\n> mvn clean install\r\n\r\nAs it's built and packaged using the Maven AppAsembler plugin, to run the application, run the `partial-pressure-calculator` script (`partial-pressure-calculator.bat` on Windows), located in the `target/appassembler/bin/` repository.\r\nThen, run this sample command:\r\n\r\n> partial-pressure --breathingMix AIR\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nPartial Pressure Calculator is an Open Source software released under the [Apache 2.0 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).",
