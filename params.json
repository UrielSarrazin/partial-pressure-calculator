  "body": "# Partial Pressure Calculator\r\n\r\nThis command-line application calculates partial pressures of the most popular breathing mixes used for diving:\r\n* Air\r\n* Nitrox 32/68\r\n* Nitrox 36/64\r\n* Nitrox 40/60\r\n* Oxygen\r\n* Trimix 20/25\r\n\r\nThese breathing mixes are composed of the following gases : O2, N2 and He.\r\n\r\nThis calculation is based on Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures that states:\r\n* each gas in a mixture of gases exerts a pressure, known as its partial pressure, that is equal to the pressure the gas would exert if it were the only gas present\r\n* the total pressure of the mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of all the gases present.\r\n\r\nA mathematical expression of the Law of Partial Pressures is:\r\n\r\n> Ptotal = P1 + P2 + P3 + · · ·\r\n\r\n## Build and Run\r\n\r\n### Using Maven and classic Command-line\r\n\r\nThis application uses Spring Shell. To build it, issue this command in the project's root directory :\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmvn clean install\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs it's built and packaged using the Maven AppAsembler plugin, to run the application, run the `partial-pressure-calculator` script (`partial-pressure-calculator.bat` on Windows), located in the `target/appassembler/bin/` repository.\r\nThen, issue this sample command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npartial-pressure --breathingMix AIR\r\n```\r\n### Using Hotshell\r\n\r\nHotshell is a productivity enhancer command-line tool. Using this tool will simplify a lot the work load to build an run the application. For more details on this tools, please refer to [Hotshell web site](http://www.moumne.com/hotshell). This open-source is hosted [here](https://github.com/julienmoumne/hotshell) on GitHub. Installation is detailed in the project's documentation.\r\n\r\nPlaced at the project's root directory, there's the `hs.js` Hotshell's javascript file :\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nitem({desc: 'partial-pressure-calculator'}, function() {\r\n\r\n    github = 'https://github.com/urielsarrazin/partial-pressure-calculator'\r\n    linux = exec('uname').indexOf('Linux') > -1\r\n    browser = linux ? 'sensible-browser' : 'open'\r\n\r\n    item({key: 'b', desc: 'build', cmd: 'mvn clean install'})\r\n    item({key: 'r', desc: 'run', cmd: './target/appassembler/bin/partial-pressure-calculator'})\r\n    item({key: 'd', desc: 'documentation', cmd: browser + ' ' + github})\r\n    item({key: 'f', desc: 'file bug report', cmd: browser + ' ' + github + '/issues/new'})\r\n})\r\n```\r\nTo use this file with Hotshell, issue the following command in the project's root directory :\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nhs -f hs.js\r\n```\r\nThe following content will appears on the console :\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npartial-pressure-calculator\r\n\r\n b build mvn clean install\r\n r run ./target/appassembler/bin/partial-pressure-calculator\r\n d documentation sensible-browser https://github.com/srielsarrazin/partial-pressure-calculator\r\n f file bug report sensible-browser https://github.com/urielsarrazin/partial-pressure-calculator/issues/new\r\n\r\n spacebar back, tabulation bash, return repeat, backspace reload, ^d or ^c quit\r\n\r\n ? _\r\n```\r\nTo build the application, stroke the `b` key, to run it stroke the `r` key, and so on...\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nPartial Pressure Calculator is an Open Source software released under the [Apache 2.0 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).",
